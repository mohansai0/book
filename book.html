          First time ninnu chusinapudu i am not that old enough and you were in relation with my best bro 
          so naku em anipinchaledu but when you came again in the lockdown time and you palyed a important role 
          in my life during that time . You made me to delete the teh game and you made me to wait for your Message.
          I still remember those days . I used to come to senior house just to see you and the happiness that i get when I saw you
          I cannot express that happiness in words even now i still feel the same . But i donr know why you have changed 
          because of that i am losing i dont know what i should do to get  you back . Please return potti
        <p>
          The day when i met you at the night is the most memorble night . I still remember the things we done on that 
          day. I still remember those scenes Ihow i climbed the way where we sat holding your hands touching your cheeks 
          talking to you and at last when we are supposedto go your grandma woke up and when i am going you were talking
          to her . When i reach home I kept more than 50 sorrys.  
        </p>
        <p>
          The most Beautiful day is oct 17th when we met on the terrece where we sat. That day i got my First
        kiss from the most beautiful girl that i have ever loved . i still remember that day you kissed me and
        touched your lips with my lips , thighs , waist . And at last i bit your lips so hard that if any one ever kissed 
        you it should remained you about me .[1] Please tell  weather any one kissed or not ? 
        </p>

          You have taught me so much and always wished the best for me I think you still do .
          You taught me how to chat with a girl , how to love a girl , how to kiss , how to hug
          you shared everything and i shared everything without. I am really sorry for that day when
          your dad saw our chats and took your phone . Even he called me warned me not to talk with you .
          
        </p>
        <p>
          At that time also you used to chat with me i feel really grateful for that . This is the reason 
          why i loved you more . Those little conversations we had in whats app at hat time 
          you used to share you experience during ur college . Sending pics of your's and your's frnds
          tell the stroy behind that pic and at last that no msg reply for is the 
          most favourite part of the chat . 

        </p>
        <p>
          A true person like you is a treasure that is hard to find. But I so am glad I
          found you! I’m blessed to have you as lover / friend /everything . Thank you for always
          being there . I love you so much that words can
          never express the actual depth of my feelings. LOVE YOU 3000 times potti
          I dont know why i am getting tears while typing this .
